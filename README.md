This is the finished midterm project. The UI is incomplete, however, it contains three API endpoints within the Movie Controller for managing movies with 3 specific features in mind.

-Retrieving all movies (this will be used on the homepage)
-Retrieving movie by id (this will be used on the user dashboard page in conjuction with the watchlist functionality as well as a movie detail screen)
-Submitting movie (this will be used with a form for users to submit movies to the website)
